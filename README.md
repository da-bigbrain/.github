- [Firmware](https://github.com/da-bigbrain/esp32_c3_mqtt) - ESP32C3 supermini chip arduino code
  - Note: `This one needs some automation, and it doesn't read EEG data and send to server yet`

### Software Repo

- [Backend](https://github.com/da-bigbrain/nf_backend_mqtt_featured_with_esp32) - Subscribe MQTT that published to broker server at `nf.enk.icu`, and process DFT(Discrete Fourier Transform) with function called fft(), emits to frontend using socket.io
